---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
Date: 2025-08-10
  Minor Features:
    - Added configurable, proactive attack groups
      -> Toggleable by planet (Nauvis and Gleba, presently)
      -> Toggleable requirement for the attack groups to spawn near spawners
      -> Configurable starting peace time before attack groups can spawn
      -> Configurable setting to control/affect the probability of attack groups actually spawning per planet
      -> Configurable settings for the frequency of attack group processing
    - Updated initialization logic to maintain when a surface is first visited (Nauvis & Gleba) on mod update
      -> Is so that the 'peace time' doesn't reset everytime the mod updates going forward
      -> 'peace time' can still be reset using the /more_enemies.init command
      -> Lays the groundwork for migrating any needed data during version updates going forward
  Bug Fixes:
    - Corrected use of force.get_evolution_factor() to include the corresponding surface as a parameter
      -> Was otherwise defaulting to Nauvis if not provided
      -> i.e. Nauvis' evolution factor was being used all the time for calculations, ignorig Gleba's actual evolution factor
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.1
Date: 2025-08-01
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed evolution factor multiplier doing almost nothing, then spiking the amount of times entities are cloned after passing a certain point
      i.e. Changed the evolution multiplier formula, where 'y' is the current evolution factor, and 'x' is the selected difficulty (Easy (0.1), Vanilla (1), Vanilla+ (1.75), Hard (4), Insanity (11)):
      -> Old
      -> https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=x%5E%28y%2F%28x%5E%28y%2Fx%29%29%29+*+%28y%5Ex%29%2C+y%3D0+to+1

      -> Current
      -> https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=x%5E%28y%2F%28x%5E%28y%2Fx%29%29%29+*+y%2C+y%3D0+to+1
  Balance:
    - Overall difficulty is higher now as a result of changing the evolution factor multipier formula
    - Difficulty should be smoother though, rather than doing seemingly little to then going from 0 to 100 very rapidly
    - Can be adjusted using the planet specific "unit spawn multiplier" settings
      -> i.e. If too many spawns, set below 1 to reduce the amount of spawns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
Date: 2025-07-25
  Minor Features:
    - Separated maximum number of clones to be per planet (Nauvis and Gleba)
      Also separated per planet limit to have separate unit and unit-group limits
      - Each one should have its own configurable runtime setting (4 total)
      Reduced the clone limit from a single setting of 1500, to four settings of 400 each
      - i.e. it's now 400 * 4 = 1600; 100 higher than the previous default limit
    - Added
      -> /more_enemies.exterminatus -> Calls game.forces.enemies.kill_all_units(), also clears all clones and staged_clones from the storage data and resets the counts to 0
      - This will literally kill all of the spawned enemy units (cloned or otherwise) on both Nauvis and Gleba (haven't tested with mods that add enemies to other planets yet)
      - Also flushes the pathfinder
      -> Depending on how large the game/save is, this may/will likely lag for a moment (500+ hour save, lags for ~5-10 seconds on initial execution)
      -> Is also executed when the mod detects an update, or when using the /more_enemies.init command
  Misc:
    - Worked on optimizing overall performance and performance with B.R.E.A.M.
      - Still working on B.R.E.A.M. compatability and performance
    - Reduced default modded clone limit to 500
      - Only applies to B.R.E.A.M. currently
    - Updated dependency version for base to 2.0.60
    - Updated optional dependency version for space-age to 2.0.60
    - Updated optional dependency version for behemoth-enemies to 0.0.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.5
Date: 2025-04-28
  Misc:
    - Added CN locale/translations
      Thanks to Houraiji-Kyuusyou for the contribution!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.4
Date: 2025-04-24
  Bug Fixes:
    - Added missing existence check
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.3
Date: 2025-04-17
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed difficulty level not applying appropriately to startup settings
      -> Makes "Easy" easier, and "Vanilla+", "Hard", and "Insanity" harder
      -> Only applies to startup settings at default values
      -> i.e. Any startup setting left at its default value will be modified by the chosen difficulty level
    - Added additional logic to try and further prevent infinite unit group cloning
    - Should now properly clean up unit groups from storage after they've finished gathering/been ordered to move
    - Created schema for storage objects to be based from
      -> Allows for simpler logic and greater maintainability
    - Added/exposed several additional settings
      -> To allow finer tuning of performance
      -> Default settings are identical to vanilla
      - Maximum number of gathering unit groups: 30
      - Maximum clients to accept any new request: 10
      - Maximum clients to accept short new request: 100
      - Direct distance to consider short request: 100
      - Short request max steps: 1000
    - Fixed a few typos that could have caused errors
      -> Were only in a few scenarios where the mod would have already been in an error state
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.2
Date: 2025-04-05
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed error on load when ArmouredBiters was present, but did not have its spawner enabled
    - Added missing existence checks before changing unit-spawner settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.1
Date: 2025-04-04
  Bug Fixes:
    - Seperated B.R.E.A.M. clone settings from planet clone settings
      - Added B.R.E.A.M. difficulty (Easy (0.1), Vanilla (1), Vanilla+ (1.75), Hard (4), Insanity (11))
      - Added B.R.E.A.M. use_evolution_factor
      - Added B.R.E.A.M. clone_units
      - Added B.R.E.A.M. do_clone (false by default)
      By default more-enemies won't track or clone B.R.E.A.M. created entities (toggleable)
    - Redid some difficulty detection
      Namely detecting Vanilla
      - No need to do some processing when difficulty is Vanilla
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2025-04-03
  Minor Features:
    - Added infrastructure to detect and support cloning of entities created by other mods, assuming they raise the 'script_raised_built' event
      -> Currently only supports B.R.E.A.M.
      - Added as an optional dependency
      Adds an additional setting for maximum number of modded clones
      Mod created entities are tracked ~somewhat independently of vanilla entities
      -> Allows for cloning of mod added entities even when othwerwise at the the maximum number of clones
      -> Maximum number of modded clones helps to prevent it froming runnning amok though
    - Tested compatibility with Cold_Biters, Explosive_Biters, and Toxic_Biters by MFerrari
      Added as optional dependencies
    - Changed the internal version checking to automatically initialize fresh upon detecting a version change
    - Cloned entities (and staged entities) are now purged upon initializing fresh
    - Updated the purge command
      Removed
      -> /more_enemeies.purge
      Added
      -> /more_enemies.purge_all -> Clears all of the cloned enemies, and enemies staged to be cloned
      -> /more_enemies.purge_clones -> Clears all of the vanilla cloned enemies, and vanilla enemies staged to be cloned
      -> /more_enemies.purge_modded_clones -> Clears all of the mod added cloned enemies, and mod added enemies staged to be cloned
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2025-03-30
  Minor Features:
    - Compatability with ArmouredBiters
    - Compatability with behemoth-enemies
    - Added console command
      /more_enemies.purge -> removes all cloned enemies, and enemies staged to be cloned
  Bug Fixes:
    - Reverted randomness of clone placement for now, as it was causing some enemies to spawn inside of their spawners
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.4
Date: 2025-03-30
  Bug Fixes:
    - Added more missing validity checks
    - Added the ability to toggle on and off the clone processing
      /more_enemies.get_do_nth_tick -> Gets the value of do_nth_tick
      /more_enemies.set_do_nth_tick X -> Sets do_nth_tick to true if X == "true", or X >= 1; otherwise sets do_nth_tick to false
      This can effectively disable cloning altogether if needed.
    - Fixed enemmy unit groups cloning all the way up to the limit despite difficulty settings
      To that end, runtime difficulty settings (the multipliers) should function properly now
    - Added some slight randomness to the placement of clones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2025-03-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - Added validity check before adding member to unit group
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2025-03-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - (Hopefully) fixed issues related to loading; should hopefully be more compatible with other mods now
      May not fully work out of the box, but hopefully should not stop the game from loading
      Not seeing issues locally anymore, other than needing to optimize performance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2025-03-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed error on load when Space Age was not present
    - Updated dependency version for base to 2.0.42 (below has not been tested)
    - Updated optional dependency version for space-age to 2.0.42 (below has not been tested)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-03-27
  Minor Features:
    - Added configurable logging in the mod settings (Log level of 'None' by default)
      Odrder of precedence: Info > Debug > Warn > Error > None (Default)
      Includes "Do not print" and "Do function traceback" settings
      Do not print: prevent log messages from displaying in game; only log to the factorio-current.log file
      Do function traceback: enables the traceback for each log statement (for aid in debugging)
    - Added console commands:
      /more_enemies.init -> Initialize the supporting data structures from scratch, erasing any existing data
      /more_enemies.reinit -> Reinitialize the supporting data structures, making a moderate attempt to maintain existing data
      /more_enemies.print_storage -> Prints the contents or the supportings data structures
      /more_enemies.version -> Prints the current mod version, and the underlying storage version
    - Added entity cloning. Applies to Nauvis and Gleba, both configurable
      If > 1, or above difficulty Vanilla, entities will be cloned when they spawn according to difficulty settings and evolution factor
      If < 1, fewer entities will be cloned for the given difficulty setting
    - Added unit group cloning. Applies to Nauvis and Gleba, both configurable
      If > 1, or above difficulty Vanilla, unit groups (enemy attack groups) will be cloned when they finish gathering according to difficulty settings and evolution factor
      If < 1, unit groups will be cloned fewer times
    - Added evolution factor [0 - 1] as a means of scaling the entity and unit group cloning more appropriately
      Can be toggled on or off. Toggling off causes the maximum amount to be spawned at the very beginning of the game.
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed Hard difficulty actually using some of the Easy settings
    - Fixed main menu simulation 'nauvis_biter_base_laser_defense' breaking when the character died on higher difficulties; now they explode!
  Balance Changes:
    - Insanity now goes to 11
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-03-14
  Minor Features:
    - Added preset difficulty settings (Easy (0.1), Vanilla (1), Vanilla+ (1.75), Hard (4), Insanity (10))
    - Each setting can selectively override what would be set by the chosen difficulty
    - By default, everything is set to vanilla
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2025-03-13
