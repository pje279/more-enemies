Version: 0.3.0
Date: 27. 03. 2025
  Minor Features:
    - Added configurable logging in the mod settings (Log level of 'None' by default)
      Odrder of precedence: Info > Debug > Warn > Error > None (Default)
      Includes "Do not print" and "Do function traceback" settings
      Do not print: prevent log messages from displaying in game; only log to the factorio-current.log file
      Do function traceback: enables the traceback for each log statement (for aid in debugging)
    - Added console commands:
      /more_enemies.init -> Initialize the supporting data structures from scratch, erasing any existing data
      /more_enemies.reinit -> Reinitialize the supporting data structures, making a moderate attempt to maintain existing data
      /more_enemies.print_storage -> Prints the contents or the supportings data structures
      /more_enemies.version -> Prints the current mod version, and the underlying storage version
    - Added entity cloning. Applies to Nauvis and Gleba, both configurable
      If > 1, or above difficulty Vanilla, entities will be cloned when they spawn according to difficulty settings and evolution factor
      If < 1, fewer entities will be cloned for the given difficulty setting
    - Added unit group cloning. Applies to Nauvis and Gleba, both configurable
      If > 1, or above difficulty Vanilla, unit groups (enemy attack groups) will be cloned when they finish gathereing according to difficulty settings and evolution factor
      If < 1, unit groups will be cloned fewer times
    - Added evolution factor [0 - 1] as a means of scaling the entity and unit group cloning more appropriately
      Can be toggled on or off. Toggling off causes the maximum amount to be spawned at the very beginning of the game.
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed Hard difficulty actually using some of the Easy settings
    - Fixed main menu simulation 'nauvis_biter_base_laser_defense' breaking when the character died on higher difficulties; now they explode!
  Balance Changes:
    - Insanity now goes to 11
