Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2025-03-31
  Minor Features:
    - Added infrastructure to detect and support cloning of entities created by other mods, assuming they raise the 'script_raised_built' event
      -> Most notably, BREAM (does not raise this event yet, sadly)
    - Tested compatibility with Cold_Biters, Explosive_Biters, and Toxic_Biters by MFerrari
      -> No changes necessary, works out of the box
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 2025-03-30
  Minor Features:
    - Compatability with ArmouredBiters
    - Compatability with behemoth-enemies
    - Added console command
      /more_enemies.purge -> removes all cloned enemies, and enemies staged to be cloned
  Bug Fixes:
    - Reverted randomness of clone placement for now, as it was causing some enemies to spawn inside of their spawners
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.4
Date: 2025-03-30
  Bug Fixes:
    - Added more missing validity checks
    - Added the ability to toggle on and off the clone processing
      /more_enemies.get_do_nth_tick -> Gets the value of do_nth_tick
      /more_enemies.set_do_nth_tick X -> Sets do_nth_tick to true if X == "true", or X >= 1; otherwise sets do_nth_tick to false
      This can effectively disable cloning altogether if needed.
    - Fixed enemmy unit groups cloning all the way up to the limit despite difficulty settings
      To that end, runtime difficulty settings (the multipliers) should function properly now
    - Added some slight randomness to the placement of clones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.3
Date: 2025-03-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - Added validity check before adding member to unit group
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2025-03-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - (Hopefully) fixed issues related to loading; should hopefully be more compatible with other mods now
      May not fully work out of the box, but hopefully should not stop the game from loading
      Not seeing issues locally anymore, other than needing to optimize performance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2025-03-29
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed error on load when Space Age was not present
    - Update dependency version for base to 2.0.42 (below has not been tested)
    - Update optional dependency version for space-age to 2.0.42 (below has not been tested)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-03-27
  Minor Features:
    - Added configurable logging in the mod settings (Log level of 'None' by default)
      Odrder of precedence: Info > Debug > Warn > Error > None (Default)
      Includes "Do not print" and "Do function traceback" settings
      Do not print: prevent log messages from displaying in game; only log to the factorio-current.log file
      Do function traceback: enables the traceback for each log statement (for aid in debugging)
    - Added console commands:
      /more_enemies.init -> Initialize the supporting data structures from scratch, erasing any existing data
      /more_enemies.reinit -> Reinitialize the supporting data structures, making a moderate attempt to maintain existing data
      /more_enemies.print_storage -> Prints the contents or the supportings data structures
      /more_enemies.version -> Prints the current mod version, and the underlying storage version
    - Added entity cloning. Applies to Nauvis and Gleba, both configurable
      If > 1, or above difficulty Vanilla, entities will be cloned when they spawn according to difficulty settings and evolution factor
      If < 1, fewer entities will be cloned for the given difficulty setting
    - Added unit group cloning. Applies to Nauvis and Gleba, both configurable
      If > 1, or above difficulty Vanilla, unit groups (enemy attack groups) will be cloned when they finish gathereing according to difficulty settings and evolution factor
      If < 1, unit groups will be cloned fewer times
    - Added evolution factor [0 - 1] as a means of scaling the entity and unit group cloning more appropriately
      Can be toggled on or off. Toggling off causes the maximum amount to be spawned at the very beginning of the game.
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed Hard difficulty actually using some of the Easy settings
    - Fixed main menu simulation 'nauvis_biter_base_laser_defense' breaking when the character died on higher difficulties; now they explode!
  Balance Changes:
    - Insanity now goes to 11
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-03-14
  Minor Features:
    - Added preset difficulty settings (Easy (0.1), Vanilla (1), Vanilla+ (1.75), Hard (4), Insanity (10))
    - Each setting can selectively override what would be set by the chosen difficulty
    - By default, everything is set to vanilla
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
